Script to use kitty as the custom terminal with Alfred

My modified script is based on pyrhos guide
[Using Kitty as a custom terminal for Alfred](https://25.wf/posts/2020-03-23-alfred-kitty.html)

The difference is that with my script, the default behavior is to execute the command into the current window, instead of opening a new window.
Opening a new window can be done by typing "-n" before the command
